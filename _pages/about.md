<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), jointly supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/people/academic-staff/zhang-chengqi/) and [Prof. Guodong Long](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/guodong.long). Prior to this, I completed my Master’s degree in the Department of Software at Shandong University under the supervision of [Prof. Yongshun Gong](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/gongyongshun/zh_CN/index.htm), where I also earned my Bachelor’s degree.

My research focuses on vision-language-action models and spatio-temporal data mining.
